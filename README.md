# Zettelkasten

Welcome to my personal slipbox. This is an attempt at building a proper note-taking system on top of vim. Also, this is an opportunity to put my work out there and learning in public. If you want to explore start with the [Index](index.md) page.

## Structure

My goal is to model this  after the 5 major academic categories and meant to mimic my analog Zettel.

- Humanities
- Sciences
    * Natural
    * Formal
    * Applied Arts
